    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a statistical analysis on the Northwind company. We will be looking at data collected on the company. This includes the sale of products, the performance of various regions within the company and other data focused on profits. SQL will be used to query information from the data after importing various libraries to help with analysis. From this point on, hypothesis tests will be conducted on the data in order to find valuable insights about the way the company functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "- Import necessary libraries into Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "- Scrub the data using SQL.  \n",
    "- Visualize the data using various types of graphs and charts.\n",
    "- Create questions based on findings.  \n",
    "- Test the hypothesis, make sure to include p-values and other statistics that are relevant to the analysis such as effect size. \n",
    "- Each question has to include a null and alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "- Write detailed results at the end of the project and utilize the markdown capability in order to present data in an organized fashion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis \n",
